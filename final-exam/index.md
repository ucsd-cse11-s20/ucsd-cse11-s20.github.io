# Final Exam

Release: 8am Monday June 8, 2020

Due: 8am Thursday June 11, 2020

This page details a **take-home exam** that you will complete over the next
few days. You can't communicate with anyone about the content of the
assignment until you receive your grade. The course staff will not give
debugging advice or answer questions about the problems. If you have
technical trouble creating a screencast (detailed below) feel free to reach
out for assistance.

You **can** make use of any course notes, online resources, Java tools, and
so on to complete the exam. Feel free to use any built-in Java features and
libraries to complete the tasks. Do not copy code from any non-course
resources. You **can** copy code that's provided as part of the course or you
used on a previous assignment for this course.

The starter code for this exam is here:

[Final exam starter code](https://github.com/ucsd-cse11-s20/final-exam-starter)

You may find some of the following resources particularly useful:

- [PA7 starter code for reading files](https://github.com/ucsd-cse11-s20/pa7)
- [Several lectures have code for a Point class with a distance definition](https://github.com/ucsd-cse11-s20/12-More-Loops/)

Submission checklist:

- `[ ]` `ClosestPoints.java`
- `[ ]` `ExamplesSearch.java` containing modified `ImageQuery` interface and
implementations for several methods
- `[ ]` Video screencast of tracing through a test for the `filter` method submitted to this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJDNNz-yI25HjdMMPFQ5bfcBsATSsHyU4OXms7wnj93AbPOg/viewform)

## Task 1

In a file called `ClosestPoints.java`, write a class called `ClosestPoints`
with a `main` method. The `main` method should expect a single command-line
argument that is the path to a file where each line contains two integers
separated by a space. The program should interpret those integers as points,
with an x coordinate followed by a y coordinate. The program should print the
two points that are _closest_ to one another. You can assume there will be at
least two lines in the file, and there is no upper limit on the number of
lines in the file. You can also assume that the file given on the command
line exists and has the given format (you don't have to check for nonexistent
files or badly-formatted numbers, etc).

Closeness is defined by the definition of `distance` we've used previously
for `Point`s; you might find previous code from lecture that defines the
`Point` class useful (but you don't have to use it). Add any additional
classes and methods you need to help you complete the program.

**Example**: The file `points.txt` contains

```
1 1
5 6
1 4
-10 5
0 0
-1 3
```

Your program should behave as follows:

```
$ javac ClosestPoints.java
$ java ClosestPoints points.txt
1 1
0 0
```

The points should be printed in the order they originally appeared in the
file. If there is a tie, print any pair (but just one pair) of points with
the shortest distance.

Make sure to test your solution thoroughly. We will grade your solution
automatically with our own tests.

## Task 2

Take the starter code for image queries that we've used for past exams
`<link>`. This is exactly the same starter code as for previous exams.

Add the following methods to the `ImageQuery` **interface**:

```java
// Returns true if any of the ImageData match this query, false otherwise
// throw an IllegalArgumentException if ids is null
// (You can choose the message in the error)
boolean any(List<ImageData> ids);

// Returns the number of ImageData in the list that match this query
// throw an IllegalArgumentException if ids is null
// (You can choose the message in the error)
int count(List<ImageData> ids);

// Returns a new list containing just the ImageData in the list that match this query
// throw an IllegalArgumentException if ids is null
// (You can choose the message in the error)
List<ImageData> filter(List<ImageData> ids);

/**
 * Returns:
 * - A new list
 * - Containing the first n ImageData in the list:
 *    - in descending order according to the comparator
 *    - that match this query
 * - If there are fewer than n matches, returns just a list of those that match
 *   (in descending order)
 * 
 * Example: The query matches on files with extension png. The comparator
 * compares the area of images. n is 3. Consider images with these properties:
 * 
 * Extension | Width | Height
 * jpg          100     200
 * png          100     200
 * png          500     600
 * jpg         1000     300
 * png          300     200
 * png          300     400
 * 
 * The resulting list should contain the images in this order (the first row is
 * index 0).
 * 
 * Extension | Width | Height
 * png          500     600
 * png          300     400
 * png          300     200
 * 
 * throw an IllegalArgumentException if ids is null, compare is null, or n is less than 0
 * (You can choose the message in the error)
 * 
 * Note that the example above is drawn as a table to make the intended values
 * clear. The method you write should not print these tables and return a list
 * as in examples we've seen before.
*/
List<ImageData> filter(List<ImageData> ids, Comparator<ImageData> compare, int n);
```

<div class='sidenote'>Just implement it for the provided classes; you should not
add previous classes like <code>EitherQuery</code> or <code>AllQuery</code> from past exams.</div>

Implement these methods for the query classes in the file. Don't make this
more complicated than you have to, and don't write more code than you have
to. What techniques do we know for avoiding code duplication across classes?

**Hint**: You will probably want to use the `sort` method that is built in to
Java `List`s:

[Java sort method](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#sort(java.util.Comparator))

An example of using it is here:

```
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Comparator;

class IntegerCompare implements Comparator<Integer> {
  public int compare(Integer n1, Integer n2) {
    return n1 - n2;
  }
}
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Construct a new ArrayList with these elements
    List<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>(List.of(1, 5, -3, 8, -2, 1, 7));
    nums.sort(new IntegerCompare());
    System.out.println(nums); // prints in sorted order
  }
}
```

Make sure to test these methods thoroughly yourself – we will grade them
automatically based on our own tests.

### Task 3 – Video

You will record a short video of no more than 5 minutes to [this Google
Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJDNNz-yI25HjdMMPFQ5bfcBsATSsHyU4OXms7wnj93AbPOg/viewform).
Include:

- Your face and your student ID for a few seconds at the beginning. You don't
  have to be on camera the whole time, though it's fine if you are. Just a
  brief confirmation that it's you creating the video/doing the work attached
  to the work itself is what we want.
- Pick a test for your `filter` method that takes a **single** argument with
  three `ImageData` references in the list.

  Run the `ExamplesSearch` program and show the output corresponding to a
  method call for this example. Then, starting from the line in your code
  with the call to the `filter` method, indicate each line of code that runs
  in your program while evaluating that method call. You can scroll to and
  click the lines to highlight them, or otherwise indicate each one. You
  should indicate them in the order that **Java will evaluate them** (this
  might be different than the order they appear in the file).

An example of what your video should look like when doing this kind of
explanation is here:
