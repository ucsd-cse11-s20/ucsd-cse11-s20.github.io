<b>This web site is under constant revision until the start of the quarter.</b>

In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and practice organizing programs for
clarity and re-use.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the
course, as well as the syllabus.

## Basics

- Podcasts: [Coming Soon]
- Q&A Forum: [Coming Soon]
- Gradescope: [https://www.gradescope.com](https://www.gradescope.com) [an invitation will be sent in the first week]
- Readings/quizzes/drill assignments: [Coming Soon]

On an average week in CSE11, you can expect to spend 4-6 hours on videos,
reading, lecture, and discussion; 2-3 hours on programming practice; and 4-6
hours working on your programming projects. If you find yourself spending
dramatically more time than this, it's a good idea to contact the course staff
and discuss more efficient strategies in office hours.

<h3>Lecture</h3>

Most lecture content will be presented asynchronously through videos and
readings. These will come with associated quizzes that are due on Tuesday and
Thursday at the start of our originally-scheduled lecture time. The quizzes are
required work to demonstrate your consistent engagement with the material.

In our originally-scheduled lecture time, we will have synchronous discussions
that will be a mix of Q&A and breakout groups working on specific problems
designed to prompt useful discussion. Attendance is encouraged by not required.
Recordings of relevant classwide discussions will be posted after the meetings,
though small group discussions may not be posted.

This is essentially a flipped classroom with the class discussion part
delivered remotely.

The scheduled lecture time is (in the time zone of San Diego) Tuesday and
Thursday from 11am-12:30pm. You can visit the lectures via:

<h3>Discussion Sections</h3>

Discussion sections will be used to demo tools and answer questions about the
programming assignment specifications. They will be recorded and released, also
have similar discussion prompts and breakout groups to work on problems.
Attendance is encouraged but optional. The discussions are (in the time zone of
San Diego) at [FILL]. You can visit the discussions at:

<h3>Schedule</h3>
The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. In a typical week, by 5pm Monday before class all due dates, readings, and notable events in the course until the following week will be posted here. So if you check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you'll know when all reading quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have the schedule confirmed more than a week out, but we'll always be at least a week ahead.
